# Introduction
I wrote this app to help me sort out the files I took with my digital camera/mobile phone into folders (sorted by date)

# How to use (Java version)
First, you need to create a `img` folder, same directory level as `src`.

Compile the source codes: `javac java_src/po/*.java -cp src -d java_po`

Run requires two parameters:

* name_of_album: Name of album
* camera_model_or_name_of_person: Either the camera you used to take the photos or the person who took the photos

Run the app: `java -cp java_po po.PhotosOrg name_of_album camera_model_or_name_of_person`

Your folder will look like this yyyy.mm.dd-name_of_album-[camera_model_or_name_of_person].

Eg. 2011.11.11-Day.at.Universal.Studios-[CSLew]


#How to use (Ruby version)

`ruby ./ruby_src/PhotoOrg.rb name_of_album camera_model_or_name_of_person`

# Hmm...
This application, I assume, will be full of bugs. It is hardcoded to pull files from a `img` directory and split the sorted photos by date into a newly created folder within `img`
